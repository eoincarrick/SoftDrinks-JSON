      "full_description": "Prosecco Bosco di Gica is produced in the Adami family business , which since 1920 , after the purchase of a vineyard from Count Balbi Valier. This vineyard gave fruit to a bond that has never been dissolved: in fact, the first Prosecco of a long tradition was produced. After about ten years Abele had an intuition to separate this vineyard from all the others, due to its peculiar characteristics and attachment; the result was that this produced the first Cru of Valdobbiadene . Today the company produces only Prosecco DOC Treviso and Valdobbiadene DOCG , and in its various facets and types it produces both traditional and particular wines based on the diversity and characteristics of each single hill. The Adami Valdobbiadene DOCG Bosco di Gica Brut is produced in the area where the first family vineyards were grown , in a small grove formerly called Bosco di Gica , from 97% glera grapes and a minority of chardonnay grapes . In a soil with a dry and calcareous clayey soil , the grapes are harvested between September 20 and October 10 and brought, after soft pressing with pneumatic presses, to static decantation. It is fermented at a controlled temperature between 17 ° C and 19 ° C with selected yeasts. After three months of agingthe most important and delicate part that makes the difference in the production of the cellar's sparkling wines takes place on the noble lees in steel: the second fermentation . According to the Italian method in steel autoclaves, the sparkling process takes place at a temperature between 15 ° C and 17 ° C with tartaric stabilization at -4 ° C to avoid crystalline formations in the bottle. Before bottling, the sparkling wine is microfiltered to remove and separate the yeast cells from the final product. Particularly predisposed to evolutionit is recommended to drink it in the year following the harvest to enjoy it at its maximum freshness, however in the following years, if well preserved, it gains both olfactory and palate complexity with potential pleasant surprises.",
