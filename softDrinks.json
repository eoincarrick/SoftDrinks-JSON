This vineyard gave fruit to a bond that has never been dissolved: in fact, the first Prosecco of a long tradition was produced. After about ten years Abele had an intuition to separate this vineyard from all the others, due to its peculiar characteristics and attachment; the result was that this produced the first Cru of Valdobbiadene . Today the company produces only Prosecco DOC Treviso and Valdobbiadene DOCG , and in its various facets and types it produces both traditional and particular wines based on the diversity and characteristics of each single hill. The Adami Valdobbiadene DOCG Bosco di Gica Brut is produced in the area where the first family vineyards were grown , in a small grove formerly called Bosco di Gica , from 97% glera grapes and a minority of chardonnay grapes . In a soil with a dry and calcareous clayey soil , the grapes are harvested between September 20 and October 10 and brought, after soft pressing with pneumatic presses, to static decantation. It is fermented at a controlled temperature between 17 ° C and 19 ° C with selected yeasts. After three months of agingthe most important and delicate part that makes the difference in the production of the cellar's sparkling wines takes place on the noble lees in steel: the second fermentation . According to the Italian method in steel autoclaves, the sparkling process takes place at a temperature between 15 ° C and 17 ° C with tartaric stabilization at -4 ° C to avoid crystalline formations in the bottle. Before bottling, the sparkling wine is microfiltered to remove and separate the yeast cells from the final product. Particularly predisposed to evolutionit is recommended to drink it in the year following the harvest to enjoy it at its maximum freshness, however in the following years, if well preserved, it gains both olfactory and palate complexity with potential pleasant surprises.",

Almond and pistachio cream lend allure; chalk and salt along with piquancy of peach kernel and toasted pumpkin seed impart interest, invigoration and saliva-inducement to an effusively juicy, succulent and refreshingly sustained finish. Seven grams of residual sugar, incidentally, is fairly high by estate standards but perfectly complements this wine’s forward fruit without engendering any sense of outright sweetness. This exceptional value in Champagne should remain irresistible for at least the next couple of years, and I shall be anxious to experience what happens further down the pike as I revisit the bottles I recently purchased (because older 'intro-level' bottles are not usually something that growers – or, for that matter, most self-styled wine collectors – can lay their hands on to pour for you).

Today, fourth-generation vigneron Pascal Agrapart runs this venerable estate, one of the most historic and important in the Côte de Blancs. Pascal's deep knowledge of both farming and winemaking have helped him become a leading figure in Champagne's grower-producer revolution. Pascal's son, Amboise, helps him manage nine and a half hectares of predominantly Chardonnay vineyards — the vast majority of which are Grand Cru — in the heart of the Côte de Blancs, primarily in the villages of Avize, Oger, Cramant and Oiry. Vine age is among the oldest in the Côte de Blancs, with many of the Agrapart’s vineyards in excess of seventy years of age, and the average overall age of the vines is a healthy forty years old. The estate has also farmed organically for years.",
